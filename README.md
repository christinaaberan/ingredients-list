Here's my prototype of the ingredients page. I enjoyed working on it!   
I especially enjoyed trying to replicate the look of the design comp as quickly as possible. It was rewarding to see fast results when rapidly prototyping without worrying too much about structure or optimization.
One thing I struggled with was keeping my components clear & organized. Some have conditionals that are a little messy. With more time I'd split some elements up into their own components, i.e. making the articles section its own component. 

Here are some other things I'd do next--

Styling:  
-add more subtle css transitions, i.e. when clicking through different ingredients or interacting with carousel  
-make the ingredients menu collapsible on mobile or have it show the menu > slide left to reveal detail page > show button to slide back to menu


Code/functionality:  
-display user-uploaded image on added ingredient pages by using FileReader to get image data  
-preload or optimize images so there isn't a delay before they appear  
-add prop validation & form validation  
-get rid of some unnecessary container divs, use more semantic html tags
